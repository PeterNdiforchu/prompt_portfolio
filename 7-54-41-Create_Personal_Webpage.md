## USER
Create a personal webpage for me, all in a single file. Ask me 3 questions first on whatever you need to know.

## ASSISTANT
Of course! To create a personalized webpage for you, I'll need some information. Please answer these three questions:

1. What's your full name or the name you'd like to be displayed on the webpage?
2. Could you provide a short bio or description about yourself (e.g., your interests, profession, hobbies)?
3. Do you have any specific color preferences or themes for the webpage's design?

## USER
My Full name is Data Achievers. I will provide the details for the bio later. I would like a white and blue theme

## ASSISTANT
Thank you for providing your name and color preferences. I'll use a white and blue theme for your webpage. Once you're ready with the details for your bio, please share them with me, and I'll proceed to create the webpage for you.

## USER
You can go ahead without the details of the bio....fill it up with other information

## ASSISTANT
Certainly! Here's a basic structure for your personal webpage using the information you provided. Feel free to add more content or modify it further as needed:
