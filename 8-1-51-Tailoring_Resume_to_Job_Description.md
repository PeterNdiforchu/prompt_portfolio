## ASSISTANT
To help your client tailor their resume to a particular job description using ChatGPT, it's important to provide clear and specific guidelines in the prompts. Here are the key pieces of information your client should provide in their prompts:

1. **Job Description**: Ask your client to provide the job description or a link to the job posting they want to tailor their resume for. This is the most critical piece of information, as it will serve as the reference for customizing the resume.

2. **Targeted Keywords and Skills**: Encourage your client to identify specific keywords, skills, and qualifications mentioned in the job description. They should list these out, so the AI can help them incorporate these keywords into their resume.

3. **Relevant Experience**: Ask your client to outline their relevant work experience, highlighting specific roles, responsibilities, and achievements that align with the job description. Provide details about the number of years they've worked in each role and any significant accomplishments.

4. **Education and Certifications**: If the job posting emphasizes certain education requirements or certifications, make sure your client mentions their educational background and any relevant certifications they hold.

5. **Personal Summary or Objective Statement**: If the job description calls for a specific type of personal summary or objective statement, request your client to provide information about their career goals and how they align with the job.

6. **Formatting and Style Preferences**: Inquire about their preferred resume format (e.g., chronological, functional, combination) and style (e.g., modern, traditional). This will help the AI generate a resume that suits their preferences.

7. **Additional Information**: If there are any specific achievements, projects, or experiences that make your client a strong fit for the job but are not found in their existing resume, have them provide these details. These can be important to emphasize in the tailored resume.

8. **Length and File Format**: Ask your client about the preferred length of the resume (e.g., one page or two pages) and the desired file format (e.g., PDF or Word).

Sample Prompt:
```
