" 95% of a data analyst/data scientist time is spent cleaning data 

 

Many of us have lived this stats in our work 

 

This stats have come to live for me in so many instances 

 

One peculiar instance that happened recently was quite striking 

 

I was working on a project to build a report with data sourced from 3 CSV files 

 

The data needed to be cleaned and transformed 

 

Cleaning the data involved removing unwanted columns  

 

Transforming the data informed extracting text from specific fields to form new fields for the report 

 

I did most of the cleaning using Python, which was very versatile at doing the job 

 

My Python script was used in Power BI as a Data source to connect to data (extract), clean and transform 

 

By-passed the transform stage in Power BI because it was already transformed so just loaded the data 

 

After preparing the report, I had to present the MVP to my manager 

 

There was a field that wasn't needed for the report and interestingly, I spent a considerable amount of time  transforming the data to get that field 

 

I've been told the importance of checking in with your stakeholders before adding any features to your dashboards or reports and now I see why 

 

Before even starting the process of collecting the data save yourself the extra work by asking what fields are relevant for the report  

 

You want to know what the end users want to see  before starting the process 

 

Some lessons are learned the hard way 

 

I hope some other report builder doesn't follow my mistake  

 

Happy day before Friday. Stay hydrated folk.

Title: Excel and SQL: Brothers from Different Mothers

Have you ever thought about how Excel and SQL are like long-lost siblings? ðŸ¤”

Let's dive into this unique connection and discover how these two seemingly different tools share more in common than you might think.

**Excel: The Spreadsheet Whiz**
Excel is like the cool, versatile cousin. It's user-friendly, visually appealing, and at the top of the list for personal and small-scale data management.

**SQL: The Data Wizard**
SQL, on the other hand, is like the wise, behind-the-scenes sibling. It excels at managing large datasets, and it's the go-to tool for businesses and data professionals.

**Different Functions, Shared DNA**
At first glance, it's easy to overlook their similarities. But here's where they share their genetic code:

**1. Data Organization**
Excel arranges data neatly into rows and columns, making it super easy to input and view. SQL does this, too, but on a grander scale. It structures databases for efficiency and quick retrieval.

**2. Data Filtering**
Excel's filters are your handy tools for sorting, while SQL's SELECT statement lets you filter out the exact data you need from massive datasets.

**3. Formulas and Functions**
Excel is famous for its formulas - SUM, AVERAGE, VLOOKUP - you name it. SQL has its arsenal of functions like COUNT, AVG, and JOIN, making data manipulation a breeze.

**4. Data Visualization**
Excel's charts and graphs help tell a story with your data. SQL is like the data scientist, delivering raw data for tools like Tableau and Power BI to create stunning visualizations.

**5. Accessibility**
Excel is on almost every desktop, while SQL runs the backend of countless websites and applications. Both are accessible and integral in their own right.

**A Powerful Duo**
Excel and SQL may seem different, but their unique strengths complement each other. Professionals often use both to handle various aspects of data management, from simple calculations to complex database queries.

**The Call to Action**
So, whether you're an Excel enthusiast or an SQL aficionado, consider broadening your horizons. Learn how these 'brothers' can work together to enhance your data management skills and boost your career opportunities.

Embrace the power of Excel and SQL - they might just be the dynamic duo you've been looking for. ðŸ’ª
