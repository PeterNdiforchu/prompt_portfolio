Here is Tobi's post:

My brother moved to Canada when he was 15 years old.

He landed in Montreal and missed his flight to Ottawa because of the border agents.

To make things worse, he didn't have a phone so we literally had no idea where he was.

But he's so intelligent! We've always known that.

So my sister and I drove to the Greyhound station and just hoped he would find his way to Ottawa.

4 hours later, he arrived! He has always been able to figure things out on his own - even in a brand new country.

He graduated high school at 15, did some networking and landed a job at Dairy Queen.

Before college, he managed to land a part-time job at Scotiabank and worked full-time during summers.

Whenever he needed extra cash, he would flip iPhones on Kijiji (just like I used to do).

During the pandemic, he learned how to trade, made $10k in profit and then paid some of his college tuition with it.

When he needed a computer for school, he built his own computer from scratch watching videos on YouTube and buying parts online.

I also once watched him use Java to code the solution to a problem I gave him in less than a day.

Last month, he graduated from Algonquin with a Computer Programming diploma.

And I have never been more proud to call him my little bro!

Well done Toni! This is only the beginning for you.

Now here is my draft post:

My sister took a course in her B.Sc final year and it changed her perspective 

 

She never really fancied the course so much so that she enrolled in another similar course 

 

That course was an Excel course 

 

My Sister is doing her B.Sc in Applied Human Nutrition 

 

She didn't think she had any use for Excel until I encouraged her to take the course 
She struggled initially with the in the course but ended up excelling with an above average grade 

Every now and then when I have Excel challenges at work I ask her for help and she always has some tips for me 

University studies are great but most people don't get the full value of their degrees 

They don't use all of the services provided to them such as academic advisors and career services 

You can literally build a DIY curriculum with the help of an academic advisor towards your career objective 

Not all courses are of equal value and some university's credit systems might not reflect the market value 

I use the 80/20 rule when picking courses I want to invest in for skill development  

There was one course in my MBA program that had 80% of the value from the entire program 

This Business Analytics course wasn't even considered of high importance by many students 

Through that course, I was introduced to so many Data Science concepts which are so pervasive in the industry  

Because of that course I figured out that I wanted a career in Data Analytics  

Flexibility is what sets us apart when figuring out our career paths  

You can't fully know what motivates you in a career until you explore different options 

I have been fortunate to explore job roles in customer service, transportation and logistics, and now finance to come to this conclusion of what I want to keep doing over the next decade 

There is still a high probability that I might still change fields in 10 years  

I am not fixated on this path, but I know what I want and what I don't want out of a career

Thank you for providing your draft post. I will now create a post for you in a style similar to Tobi Oluwole's. Here's the revised draft:

"My little brother's college journey began in a direction he never expected.

He entered his Applied Human Nutrition program without much enthusiasm, and in his final year, he stumbled upon a surprising course: Excel.

Who would've thought that a nutrition major would find Excel so valuable?

Initially, he struggled to grasp the spreadsheets and formulas, but determination and curiosity pushed him to excel, earning an above-average grade.

Now, whenever I face Excel challenges at work, he's my go-to source for tips and solutions.

University life is a treasure trove of opportunities, and it's not just about the degree you earn. It's about how you shape your own path.

Far too often, students overlook valuable resources like academic advisors and career services, missing out on opportunities to customize their education toward their career goals.

I've learned that not all courses are created equal. Some might not align with your career aspirations, and a university's credit system might not reflect the market's demand.

I've adopted the 80/20 rule when selecting courses. One course during my MBA, Business Analytics, delivered 80% of the program's value. Surprisingly, it wasn't a popular choice among my peers.

This course introduced me to Data Science concepts, a field with wide-reaching applications across industries. It ignited my passion for Data Analytics.

The key to finding your path is flexibility. You can't truly understand what motivates you until you explore various options.

I've been fortunate to dip my toes in different fieldsâ€”customer service, transportation and logistics, and now finance. Each experience has shaped my career perspective, but I remain open to change in the future.

While I'm on my current path, I know it's not set in stone. I'm not fixated on one career track, but I do know what I want and what I don't want. And that's what makes the journey so exciting."
